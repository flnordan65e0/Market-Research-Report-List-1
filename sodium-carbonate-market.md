<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Carbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Light Sodium Carbonate</li><li>Dense Sodium Carbonate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sodium carbonate, commonly known as soda ash, is categorized into two market types: light sodium carbonate and dense sodium carbonate. Light sodium carbonate has a lower bulk density and is used in applications requiring rapid dissolution, such as detergents and chemicals. Dense sodium carbonate, with higher bulk density, is preferred in glass manufacturing and industrial processes due to its stability and ease of handling. Both types are derived from the same chemical composition but differ in physical properties and end-use applications.</p></p>
